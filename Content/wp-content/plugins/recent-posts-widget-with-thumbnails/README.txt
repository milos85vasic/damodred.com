List of your site&#8217;s most recent posts, with clickable title and thumbnails.

== Description ==

The plugin is available in English, German (Deutsch), Persian (فارسی), Arabic (العربية), Polish (Polski) Russian (русский), Turkish (Türkçe), Japanese (日本語) and Greek (Ελληνικά).

= Lightweight, simple and effective =

No huge widget with hundreds of options. This plugin is based on the well-known WordPress default widget 'Recent Posts' and extended to display more informations about the posts like e.g. thumbnails, excerpts and assigned categories.

The thumbnails will be built from the featured image of a post or of the first image in the post content. If there is neither a featured image nor a content image then you can define a default thumbnail.

You can set the width and heigth of the thumbnails in the list. The thumbnails appear left-aligned to the post titles in left-to-right languages. In right-to-left languages they appear right-aligned.

To design the list and its items you can use these CSS selectors:

The elements which contain the posts lists:
`.rpwwt-widget`

The lists which contain the list items:
`.rpwwt-widget ul`

All list items in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li`

All list items of sticky posts in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li.rpwwt-sticky`

All links in the lists; every link contains the image and the post title:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a`

All images in the lists (use that to set the margins around images):
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a img`

All post titles in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a span.rpwwt-post-title`

All post author in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li div.rpwwt-post-author`

All post categories in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li div.rpwwt-post-categories`

All post dates in the lists:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li div.rpwwt-post-date`

All post excerpts in the lists: 
`.rpwwt-widget ul li div.rpwwt-post-excerpt`

All numbers of comments in the lists: 
`.rpwwt-widget ul li div.rpwwt-post-comments-number`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

The WordPress version should be at least 2.9 to use featured images.

The theme should support `wp_head()` in the HTML header section to print the CSS code for a beautiful alignment of the thumbnails.

= Can I set a default thumbnail? =

Yes. Type in the web address of the thumbnail and click on "Save". That's all.

= Can I set the width and height of the thumbnail? =

Yes. You can enter the desired width and height of the thumbnails or select one of the sizes as set in 'Settings' > 'Media'.

= Can I change the alignment of the thumbnails in the list? =

To keep the plugin lightweight: no. Please set the alignment in the CSS of your theme instead.

= Where can I set the CSS of the list? =

To keep the plugin lightweight: no. Please set the CSS in the Customizer at "Additional CSS".

= Can the plugin take the first image of a post as thumbnail image? =

Yes. It works with images previously uploaded into the media library. You can select to prefer the first image to the featured image or to use the first image only.

= How to keep HTML tags in the excerpts? =

Use the "Excerpt" box below the editor on a post edit page in the backend. The plugin uses those user-defined excerpts unchanged "as is".

If there is no text in the "Excerpt" box the plugin tries to build an excerpt via the post content. Since there is the "maximum length of the excerpt" option shortening the HTML content would lead to severe layout errors. So before shortening all HTML tags and shortcodes are removed.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

If you want to contribute a translation of the plugin in your language it would be great! You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. The first screenshot shows the widget in the sidebar with five teasers of current posts. Each list item shows the title, image, date, assigned categories and excerpt of a post.
2. The second screenshot shows the widget on the Widget Management Page in the backend.
