= What layouts can I use to showcase my Instagram feed? =

Instagram Feed plugin provides 4 beautiful layouts, which you can use to showcase the photos and videos on your Instagram feeds. Each of them can be fully personalized to fit the style of your website.

  * Masonry,
  * Blog Style,
  * Image Browser.

Let's go through all 4 layouts and help you choose the one that suits your site the best.

**Thumbnails Layout**

**Thumbnails Layout** of Instagram Feed plugin provides an equally aligned beautiful Instagram grid, consisting of the thumbnail images of the media on your feed. All thumbnails on this layout are set to have the same dimensions, and you can assign the width and height you like.

**Masonry Layout**

Just like Thumbnails, **Masonry Layout** is also built with the thumbnail images of Instagram posts. However, its Instagram grid is not aligned equally. The thumbnail images are created as the exact miniatures of their large versions (i.e. the dimensions of thumbnails and large posts are proportional).

**Blog Style Layout**

**Blog Style Layout** is a perfect choice if you want to post a media file on Instagram and repost the content to WordPress website as a photo blog. The images are displayed with larger dimensions, than on Thumbnails and Masonry Layouts.

You can enable captions, descriptions, and hashtags of the media and show them below the posts on your feed.

**Image Browser Layout**

Just like Blog Style, **Image Browser Layout** of Instagram Feed plugin also displays the posts with larger dimensions. However, this layout shows a single large image with navigation buttons, similar to a slideshow. You can navigate through the posts by clicking on **Next** and **Previous** buttons.

**Number of Media for Initial Preload.** Specify the number of posts to preload, when an Instagram feed is first loaded. This option helps to load a few posts at once, then navigate through the media smoothly. Note, that this setting applies to **Image Browser** feeds only.

  * Optimal,
  * Standard (640 pixels),
  * Low (320 pixels),

In case **Optimal** is selected, the dimensions of the loaded media are calculated according to the width of feed container. This provides fast loading and no stretching images.

**Featured Image.** Set the featured image of the header section of your Instagram feed. The image is pulled from the **user profile** or **hashtag** you select.

**Show Feed Header.** Activate this option to display a header on your Instagram feed. It includes **Feed Title** and **Featured Image** you specified.

= Can I create mixed Instagram feeds my Instagram account and multiple hashtags? =

This option is available in **Premium** version. There, you can create mixed Instagram feeds with your Instagram account and several hashtags. You can even create the combination of both.

= I see an invalid access Token error. What should I do? =

If you are seeing this alert message on your Instagram Feed plugin, please note, that Instagram access tokens expire from time to time. Therefore you need to get new from your Instagram account again.

Please sign in to your Instagram account and get a new token. Add it to **Instagram Feed > Settings** page.

If the token will still cause "Invalid access token" error, revoke access for the plugin [here](www.instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/) and sign in again from **Settings** page.

= I would like to display only the Instagram posts which have certain hashtags. How can this be done? =

*You can definitely do this with premium version!*

In case you wish to showcase Instagram feeds with additional, more definitive filters, **Conditional Filters** feature of Instagram Feed plugin will help you with it. This functionality allows you to show images of your Instagram account with a specific hashtag, skip images which belong to certain hashtags, and more.

To begin creating additional filters for your Instagram feed, edit it and navigate to **Conditional Filters** tab. Use **Enable Conditional Filters** to activate the necessary tools.

**Feeds to Filter** option shows the basis for conditional filters. These are the username and hashtags you have added to your Instagram feed. The filters will search among the posts of the username and hashtags, and pull those which fulfill the specified condition.

Now let's configure the condition itself. First, you need to choose the logical operator of the condition using **Filter Logic** setting. Select one of the following 3 operators:

  * AND: Shows Instagram posts that belong to **all sources** of filtering.
  * OR: Shows Instagram media which belong to **at least one of the sources** of filtering.
  * NOR: Hides Instagram posts which belong to **at least one of the sources** of filtering.

Afterwards, use **Add Condition** option to specify the parameter for the condition, which can be one of the following.

  * **Hashtag.** If you wish to filter your accout feed with a certain hashtag, you can use this option.
  * **Mention.** This option can be used for feeds both with hashtags and username, i.e. you can display posts where another user is mentioned.
  * **Description.** Just like Mentions, Description can be used both with hashtags and username. You can specify a single keyword or a phrase, which is used in descriptions of your Instagram posts.
  * **Instagram Media Link.** You are able to filter using the shareable link of Instagram media. Simply provide the full URL of the post, as the following example: https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6H6G9lmCQ/

Afterwards, select the **Condition Type** for the filter, which corresponds to the parameter you are adding. For instance, in case you are adding #liveauthentic hashtag, the **Condition Type** needs to be set as **Hashtag** as well.

Lastly, click **Add Condition** button, and the parameters you have added will be visible below **Result** section. Make sure to press **Save** after you finish configuring the filters.

With **Result** option, you will see all of the added filters which will be applied to your Instagram feed.This feature is widely used on Instagram for eCommerce websites, as it serves like an Instagram feed with analytics.

Firstly, you need to assign custom **wdi_feed_loaded** event of the plugin to the container of the Instagram feed, then set callback function for this event.

Here is an example of a script, which expands captions of posts with 0, 1, 2, 3 indexes:

`jQuery('#wdi_feed_0').on('wdi_feed_loaded',function(){
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(0).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(1).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(2).trigger('click');
  jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(3).trigger('click');
});`

Make sure to **Save** Changes after you finish modifying Advanced Options.

== Privacy Policy ==
10Web Instagram Feed plugin uses Instagram API on website front end. You have to authorize the plugin via sign in to get data from Instagram on your behalf. The plugin does not send any user’s data to Instagram. All the data received from Instagram via API is cached in WordPress database for some short customizable period to provide front end optimization. You can delete or update cached data. Instagram saves some cookies in browsers of website visitors via API data. These cookies are mostly used for security purposes. They are regulated under terms of Instagram’s privacy policy https://instagram.com/legal/privacy. The plugin asks for your consent to collect site administrator’s email address and site URL to offer customer support, deals and discounts on premium products and more.
